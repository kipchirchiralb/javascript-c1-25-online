Task 1: Odd or Even Counter
Write a function count_odd_even(nums) that takes a list of integers as input. The function should count how many of the numbers are odd and how many are even, and then print out the counts.
Use a loop to go through the list of numbers.
Use an if-else statement to check if a number is odd or even.
Print/log the counts of odd and even numbers.


Task 2: Number Checker
Write a function check_numbers_in_range(start, end) that takes two integers, start and end, as arguments. The function should print all numbers between start and end (inclusive) that are divisible by both 3 and 5.
Use a loop to iterate over the range of numbers.
Use an if statement to check divisibility by both 3 and 5.
Print each number that meets the condition.


Task 3: Countdown Timer
Write a function countdown_timer(seconds) that takes an integer seconds as input. The function should print a countdown from the given number of seconds down to 0, and display "Time's up!" once the countdown finishes.
Use a while loop to perform the countdown.
Use an if statement to check when the countdown reaches 0 and print "Time's up!".
