// In javascript we create variables using const, let and var keywords

const email = "albert@eldohub.co.ke" // constant variable- it will not change at any point as the application is running

let score = 10 // this variable, the value can be changed/modified/reassigned as the app is running

// var was used before es6(2015) to create variables before let and const were introduced. 
var age = 60
